# Rosevear Comms Hub

Shared Quo-lite communication hub for RosieDazzlers and DevilnDove.

This repository is the source of truth and first runnable scaffold for a shared customer communication platform: contacts, conversations, phone/SMS readiness, quote/custom-order intake, follow-up tasks, and AI-assisted summaries/drafts.

## Current stage

**QL-017 — Protected Intake Dry-Run Runtime Verification**

QL-017 adds the dry-run verification plan and helper for the protected website intake runtime path. It verifies the expected disabled, rejected, and dry-run response modes before any live website form can be connected.

The protected intake endpoint and intake persistence both remain disabled by default. No public website is connected live yet. No public anonymous Supabase table policies are added. The frontend still does **not** perform live customer-data reads or writes.

No live phone, SMS, AI sending, call recording, number forwarding, or number porting is active in this stage.

## Repository

```text
RosevearCreations/rosevear-comms-hub
```

GitHub repository page:

```text
https://github.com/RosevearCreations/rosevear-comms-hub
```

## Supabase project

```text
Project name: rosevearcreations Project
Project ref: gxujcwpktaickcgzyvnu
Project URL: https://gxujcwpktaickcgzyvnu.supabase.co
Status: ACTIVE_HEALTHY
```

Use this value for `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`:

```text
https://gxujcwpktaickcgzyvnu.supabase.co
```

Use the **Publishable key** from Supabase API Keys for `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`. Do not use the secret/service-role key in the browser.

## GitHub environments and variables

For this repository, use these GitHub Environment titles only when a deployment workflow requires environment-scoped settings:

```text
preview
production
```

Use repository-wide Actions variables first unless a workflow specifically says it uses environments.

Repository variables/secrets location:

```text
Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
```

Browser-safe Vite values for login/reference-read testing:

```text
VITE_ENABLE_HOSTED_DATABASE=true
VITE_ENABLE_SUPABASE_CLIENT=true
VITE_ENABLE_SUPABASE_LOGIN=true
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://gxujcwpktaickcgzyvnu.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<publishable key from Supabase>
```

Protected intake endpoint values stay disabled until deployment review:

```text
ENABLE_PROTECTED_INTAKE_ENDPOINT=false
ENABLE_INTAKE_PERSISTENCE=false
ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING=false
ENABLE_INTAKE_IDEMPOTENCY=false
DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=vercel
DEPLOYMENT_RUNTIME_WRAPPER=vercel_serverless_function
PROTECTED_INTAKE_DRY_RUN_EXPECTED_MODE=disabled
PROTECTED_INTAKE_PREVIEW_URL=
ALLOWED_INTAKE_ORIGINS=https://rosiedazzlers.ca,https://devilndove.com,https://devilndove.online
```

Only add this as a server-side secret when endpoint testing begins:

```text
INTAKE_SHARED_SECRET=<long random shared secret>
```

Do not commit service-role keys, secret keys, database passwords, JWT secrets, connection strings, or intake shared secrets.

## Auth redirect URLs

For local testing, add this Supabase Auth redirect URL:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

For a hosted preview or production deployment, add the deployed app URL after it exists. Do not use the GitHub repo URL as the Supabase Auth redirect URL; the redirect URL must be the running app URL.

## Website intake path

The selected first wrapper path remains:

```text
runtimes/vercel/api/intake.ts
```

The dry-run verification helper is:

```text
api/deployment/protectedIntakeDryRunVerification.ts
```

The safe future path remains:

```text
Public website form
→ protected server-side endpoint
→ validation + origin check + shared secret
→ disabled/dry-run verification first
→ server-side write only after later persistence gates
→ admin review before reply
```
