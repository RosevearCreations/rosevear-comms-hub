## QL-067 — Phone/SMS Controlled Live Enablement Live-Pilot Disabled Operator Console Post-Closure Readiness Review

Status: complete.

Result:

- Added disabled operator console post-closure readiness review helper at `api/deployment/phoneSmsControlledLiveEnablementLivePilotDisabledOperatorConsolePostClosureReadinessReview.ts`.
- Added post-closure readiness review contract fixture at `api/contracts/phone-sms-controlled-live-enablement-live-pilot-disabled-operator-console-post-closure-readiness-review.example.json`.
- Updated the disabled operator console to show QL-067 stage, readiness review cards, variable-name-only review, readiness blocks, and disabled future actions.
- Added source-of-truth doc at `docs/80_PHONE_SMS_CONTROLLED_LIVE_ENABLEMENT_LIVE_PILOT_DISABLED_OPERATOR_CONSOLE_POST_CLOSURE_READINESS_REVIEW.md`.
- Added build record, remote operator checklist, ops checklist, and telephony post-closure readiness note.
- Confirmed QL-067 remains post-closure-readiness-review-only and approves only a later disabled interface pathway decision gate.
- Confirmed closed evidence remains synthetic, redacted, review-only, closure-only, unsafe to persist, and free of secrets, callback tokens, live phone numbers, message bodies, transcripts, recordings, live customer data, enabled runtime evidence, hosting changes, archive writes, and retention policy writes.
- Confirmed variable handling remains name-only and does not capture secret values.
- Confirmed rejected evidence categories remain blocked after closure and visible in the disabled operator console.
- Confirmed future action buttons remain disabled and cannot send SMS, call customers, connect providers, attach live numbers, add hosting, or start live pilot runtime.
- Kept provider webhooks unconfigured.
- Kept provider callbacks, live phone webhooks, SMS sending, call recording, AI drafts, AI auto-send, persistence writes, live customer reads, live customer writes, dry-run execution, provider delivery, archive writes, retention policy writes, provider account connection, provider live-number attachment, callback registration, and live pilot runtime disabled.
- Did not add Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or GitHub Pages deployment.
- Did not add a Supabase migration.
- Did not connect a provider account.
- Did not enable any provider callback route.

## QL-068 — Phone/SMS Controlled Live Enablement Live-Pilot Disabled Interface Pathway Decision Gate

Goal:

- Decide the disabled interface pathway before any hosting or live-pilot behavior can be considered.
- Compare GitHub Pages, Supabase-hosted backend functions, and existing no-Vercel/no-Cloudflare constraints without deploying or enabling anything.
- Confirm the interface pathway does not expose service-role secrets, provider credentials, callback tokens, live customer data, or live phone/SMS runtime controls in the browser.
- Confirm the operator console remains reachable, visible, reviewable, and fully disabled in production.
- Keep all provider callbacks, phone webhooks, SMS sending, recording, AI, persistence writes, live customer access, dry-run execution, provider delivery, archive writes, retention policy writes, provider account connection, provider live-number attachment, callback registration, hosting deployment, and live pilot runtime disabled unless a later build explicitly proves and enables a controlled path.
